The curriculum is focused on all types of companies, in this case more specifically for multimedia teachers.This has a short description of who I am of my skills, in this case it also has some experiences that are not real, but are to show how it would look in a real case.I have used a color palette of grays and blacks(#f5f5f5,#444), and a red color to highlight the email.And a typography called georgia.I have taken inspiration in the typical American resumes, but in this case I have put a small photo, since I did not have any photos of myself, I have put a simulated photo.
